Through Scout's innocent perspective, the novel explores themes of racial injustice, moral growth, compassion, and the loss of innocence. Harper Lee crafts a powerful narrative about standing up for what's right, even when faced with overwhelming opposition from society.",
        
        "1984": "Winston Smith lives in a dystopian super-state called Oceania, dominated by the Party and its leader Big Brother. The Party maintains absolute control through constant surveillance, manipulation of history, and the eradication of independent thoughtâ€”'thoughtcrime.' When Winston begins a forbidden love affair with Julia and connects with what he believes is a resistance movement, he dreams of rebellion. George Orwell's nightmarish vision explores totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and the degradation of language as a tool for limiting freedom of thought.",
        
        "Pride and Prejudice": "In the Regency era English countryside, Elizabeth Bennet and her four sisters find their lives upended when wealthy bachelor Mr. Bingley and his friend, the aloof Mr. Darcy, arrive in their neighborhood. Elizabeth's initial dislike of the proud Mr. Darcy gradually transforms as she discovers his true character. Jane Austen's beloved novel delves into themes of marriage, social status, wealth, and reputation while showcasing her sharp wit and social commentary through memorable characters navigating the rigid social hierarchy of early 19th century England.",
        
        "The Great Gatsby": "Set in the Roaring Twenties on Long Island, the novel follows mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his obsession with beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Narrated by Gatsby's neighbor Nick Carraway, the story unfolds as Gatsby tries to rekindle his romance with Daisy, now married to the brutish Tom Buchanan. F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece is a critique of the American Dream, examining themes of decadence, idealism, social upheaval, and excess against the backdrop of the Jazz Age, ultimately revealing the hollow nature of materialism and the corruption of dreams."
